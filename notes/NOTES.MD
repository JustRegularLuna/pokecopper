# Pokémon RedGold/BlueSilver
Deeply nostalgic, yet brand new.
Hopefully will capture the feeling of playing Gen 2 for the very first time again.

## Feature/Engine Notes
- Uses pokegold as the base, hacked to mimic running in SGB mode while on GBC.
- Palettes should be taken from Space World for Johto.
- Kanto will reuse the SGB palettes from RBY for town palettes.
- Attempt to mimic Space World demo’s layouts for various menus.
- Change the PokéGear design too?
- Skateboard ported from Space World?
- Alternately, Skateboard as Running Shoes, and the bike works as a “prototype acro and mach bike”?
- Make sure to preserve all link functions, including Time Capsule if possible.

## Battle Mechanics Notes
- Silph Scope Ghosts and Safari Zone battles ported from Gen 1.
- All Pokémon from Space World + Lugia
- Rearrange the Pokemon list slightly to make more sense. Put Leafeon with Espeon and Umbreon, for example?
- NO PHYSICAL SPECIAL SPLIT
- NO FAIRY TYPE
- NO ABILITIES AND NATURES
- Use the beta held item effects too.
- Fix the custom Pokéball bugs.
- Use all original Gen 1 moves, and a mixture of Gen 2, Space World, and custom moves.
- Keep the Dark and Steel types. Tweak the strength/weakness table to mimic Space World.
- Shiny rate from Space World instead of final GSC?
- Include non-canon changes from Gen 1 and 2's mechanics, so long as they are interesting and they fit

## Region/General Notes
- Johto cities use the beta towns leftover in the normal Gold/Silver roms, edited when needed to make sense, and remastered using primarily graphics from the Space World demo.
- Keep the Magnet Train in mind, its stations were different in the beta cities.
- Johto routes will draw inspiration from Gold in some places, Space World in others, and also just have new things, since no beta Johto routes were leftover to go along with the cities (well, there were some in a leak, but not to go with the cities I'm using)
- Johto’s badge check, Victory Road, and Pokémon League are in a reworked Mt. Silver, called Mt. Fuji and Silver City.
- Kanto uses a mix of Yellow and Spaceworld tiles. More map changes than in final GSC.
- Kanto is full RBY size, NOT shrunken down, no areas removed
- Museum and other places are included
- Fossil sprites in Kanto’s Museum
- Include the Haunted House somewhere in Johto, from the unused entry in the area name list.
- Shipwreck
- Mine caves
- Johto has a Power Plant as well
- Aquarium from Space World
- SS Anne, not the SS Aqua. Mew under the truck?
- Abandoned Subway station in Goldenrod instead of Underground, maybe
- Maybe Johto is called Kansai, since Kanto is called Kanto?

## Story Notes
- Unchosen player as an additional rival?
- DO NOT WORRY ABOUT STICKING TO THE REGULAR GEN 2 STORY
- Events in Silent Hills should draw some inspiration from Space World’s story mode
- Battle with Prof Oak somewhere late game
- New events with Team Rocket to incorporate Giovanni and Imposter Professor Oak
- Fossils are found at Ruins of Alph?
- Make sure other starters are available too, like Yellow
- Pharmacy in Ecruteak sells the herbal remedies and gives the SECRETPOTION. No herbal shop in Goldenrod Underground. Underground may not exist.
