Engine and Effect changes from vanilla:

- Restore unfinished kanto badge screen on Trainer Card

- Restore Gen 1 Mimic menu
- Restore Safari Zone mechanic
- Restore Ghost Battle mechanic

- Curse always works the way it does for Ghost Types in final (to be like spaceworld)

- Change Amnesia to boost Spc Atk instead of Def? Or both?
  - the Amnesia Psyduck from Stadium clearly used it to boost Spc Atk, so I feel this is sticking with the original intent
