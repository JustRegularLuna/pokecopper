# Pokémon 2: Copper & Tin Versions

This is a WIP rom hack made from the disassembly of Pokémon Gold and Pokémon Silver.

It is my own imagining of what the Gen 2 Pokémon games might have been if various beta elements had been kept and elaborated on instead of scrapped.
It references beta content leftover in the final builds, content from the leaked Space World '97 demo, pre-release magazine scans, etc. along with a hefty dose of creative license to fill in the very large gaps.


To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
